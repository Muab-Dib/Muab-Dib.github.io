			<p>WIP</p>
			<p>This is the about me page. My name is Luna Stephenson, and I'm a transwoman (she/her). I am a programmer who loves analyzing code to understand it, debugging, and fixing it. I've been coding for about 6 years (since 2018) when I went to a trade school for programming. But I haven't coded as much outside of school til recently.</p>
			<p>Aside from coding, I do enjoy reading the occasional manga and anime, and I LOVE playing video games. Like a lot! Though I haven't played too many as of late, but I plan to play Elden Ring soon. Also, my favorite game of all time is Fallout: New Vegas. Though, the ones that had the biggest impact on my life are Guilty Gear: Strive (thanks Bridget!) and Celeste (Huh, what a pattern). </p>
			<p>Coding languages: C#, C++, C, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Scheme, Prolog, Assembly, React.js</p>
			<p>OS: Linux, Windows, iOS</p>
