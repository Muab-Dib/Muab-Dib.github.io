			<p>Welcome my website! My name is Luna Stephenson, and I am a Computer-Science student. (mostly programming and debugging). I made this site to brush up on my programming skills, as well as to have fun! Why did I choose such an old style? Well, modern designs may be nicer and more sleek, but honestly... I just find it appealing. Its like a relic.

			But anyhow. On this website, you can find my contact links, some info about me, my GitHub content, Resume, and so much more! This website will be constantly expanding and its meant to be just a portfolio and personal side-project sorta thing. But I hope you enjoy!</p>
